# Observer Pattern in C++

This code implements the Observer design pattern to create a system for notifying and updating multiple observers when the state of a subject (a `CounterClock` in this case) changes.

## Observer and Subject Classes

- `Observer` is an abstract class with a pure virtual function `update()`, serving as the base class for all concrete observers.
- `Subject` is another abstract class with methods to add, remove, and notify observers. It maintains a collection of observers as pointers.

## CounterClock Class

- Inherits from `Subject` and represents a clock with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- It has setter methods for setting the time and getter methods for retrieving the time components.

## DigitalClock and AnalogClock Classes

- Both inherit from `Observer` and represent different types of clocks that observe the `CounterClock`.
- They override the `update()` method to respond to changes in the `CounterClock`'s state.
- They have a `draw()` method that prints the current time.

## Main Function

- Creates an instance of `CounterClock` named `timer`.
- Creates instances of `DigitalClock` and `AnalogClock`, subscribing them to the `timer`.
- Sets the time of the `timer` to 12:30:59.
- When the time is set, both the `DigitalClock` and `AnalogClock` update and display the current time.

This code demonstrates the Observer pattern, where the `CounterClock` is the subject, and `DigitalClock` and `AnalogClock` are observers. When the subject's state changes, it notifies and updates all registered observers. This design allows for a flexible way to handle events or changes in a system with multiple observers.
